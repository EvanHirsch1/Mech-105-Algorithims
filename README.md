# Mech-105-Algorithims
#### All the algorithims made in the Mech 105 Class at CSU, created with Matlab#
## (1/3) Simpsons Rule Numerical Integration
##### This algorithim asks for an input of an x and y table and evaluates the integral over the range given. This is a numerical method so not the answer will not be exact. Keep in mind, this is numerical integration not analytical integration so using an equation as oppose to a set of x and y tables will result in an error.
